# X57-Coin

The experimental, groundbreaking cryptocurrency. X57-Coin was originally just a toy for me to test new ideas, but this early release now contains everything needed to get started. X57-Coin is designed to be 100% anonymous and hopes to improve on techniques used by Monero.

* Block Time: 30 seconds
* Max Supply: 512 billion coins
* Ticker: X57 (Subject to change)

I've already contacted several exchanges requesting to be listed. Sorry if the initial blockchain sync is a bit buggy, and the GUI client's a bit rough!
